				<h1>Background</h1>
				<p id="background">"Digital forensic tools are used for post-mortem investigation of cyber-crimes and cyber-attacks both in corporate and government organizations. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)â€™s Computer Forensics Tool Testing Program (CFTT) established standards for digital forensic tools to help determine the quality and integrity of such tools. The quality and integrity of these tools are especially important in judicial proceedings. Using a forensic tool that does not follow the standards may cause evidence to be thrown out in court cases (which are increasingly reliant on digital data). Consequently, incorrect results from a forensic tool can also lead improper prosecution of an innocent defendant. The focus of our proposed research is about standardization of one class of forensic tools that are for Deleted File Recovery (DFR). The CFTT standard for DFR tools consists of four core features and a set of optional features"</p><br>
				
				<h1>Process</h1>
				<p id="process">We used the following process to create the cases into images that can be used against the DFR Tools to get results and compare them.<br><br>
				<strong>Generating Test Cases:</strong><br>
                <p class="process_points">1. Zero out partition (make sure drive is entirely empty).</p>
                <p class="process_points">2. Use standard files (size and contents) to fill up flash drive with scenario.</p>
                <p id="pp2a">a. Files were created in 1 Megabyte (MB) block sizes unless specified otherwise.</p>
                <p class="process_points">3. Delete appropriate files that we are testing to be found.</p>
                <p class="process_points">4. Create image of drive using dd tool.</p><br>
                <p id="evalDFRtools"><strong>Evaluating DFR Tools:</strong> For each tool, the following process was followed</p>
				<p class="process_points">1. Mount image in Linux for DFR software to recognize and run against OR</p>
				<p class="process_points">2. Use the image file directly in the DFR software</p>
				<p class="process_points">3. Export results and upload to GitHub for team</p>
				<p class="process_points">4. Analyze results compared to NIST Standards</p>
			    </p><br>

                <h1>Test Cases</h1> 
				<p id="test_cases">We created the cases with different scenarios in mind and possibilities of users deleting data. All diagrams can be found on Appendix B. Here are a few examples of very common instances that can show the importance of a reliable DFR tool.
                Case 1 (Data is deleted). This case is the base standard for all tools. The purpose of this case is to test all the tools to see if they identify and recover a single deleted file. Criminals or users can inadvertently delete critical data and believe it is gone forever.</p>
                <img src="images/case1">
                <p id="test_cases">Case 4i (Data is deleted and overwritten in hopes of not being found). This test is a bit more complicated, for both the tool and how it happens. It is possible to find methods and tools that promise creating a new file to ensure the deleted file is gone forever. By overwriting the first portion of the deleted file, the goal is to prevent the tool from recognizing A. However, according to NIST standards, the tools should be able to recover as much of file A as possible without recovering file B.</p>
                <img src="images/case4i">
                <p id="test_cases">Case 5i (Data is deleted and overwritten and deleted again in hopes of only the most recently deleted data is retrieved). Even more complicated than the previous example. By deleting file B that overwrote A, the purpose is to make the tools believe that file B is part of A. However, according to NIST standards, the tools should recover file A and file B separately.</p>
